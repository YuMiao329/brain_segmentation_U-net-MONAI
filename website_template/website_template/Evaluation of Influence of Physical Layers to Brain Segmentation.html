    In this project, we used a computer-aided diagnosing system to segments the brain
    lesion from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanned images with multiple
    convolutional layers to simulate the effects of physical layers.The dataset is Brain
    MRI segmentation from Kaggle. This dataset contains brain MR images from 110
    patients from 5 institutions with 3930 brain MRI images and 3930 manual FLAIR
    abnormality segmentation masks. The images were obtained from The Cancer
    Imaging Archive (TCIA)[1]. The U-net model is adapted from MONAI frame
    work[2]. All images are preprocessed by multiple three-by-three convolutional
    layers and one one-by-one convolutional layer to simulate the illumination effects.
    After training, the results are evaluated by pixel accuracy metric and the perfor-
    mance score are calculated. For future work, there are multiple parameters such as
    adding gaussian kernel and changing gamma value of contrasts could be tunned to
    test out the performance of the model.
